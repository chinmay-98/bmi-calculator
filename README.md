# BMI calculator
Ok, pretty much everybody knows what a BMI calculator is. \
This project is just a demonstration as well as a learning step for us. \
We are trying to show how a simple code like this can be implemented and made production-ready through various frontend and backend tools. 

### We are using the following tools:
* Python - for backend
* HTML/CSS/JS/React - frontend
* FastAPI - to write endpoints
